<p>My name is Arleth Salgado Martinez i am currently learning programming,i do have to say that it is a bit stressfull but it is definitely satisfying seeing your hard work pay off. Well to start off, 
    i recently graduated high school. I took a small compter iformational class my junior yearand wasnt fascinated much by the hardware, like it was beautiful and all, but its not for me. Senior year was 
    around the corner and i had no interest/motivition to continue studying about computers in general. I remember seeing a Software Development class sometime that year so i decided to open myself up to 
    more opportunities. At first i had absolutely no idea what i was doing but little by little i started to learn a little bit more about coding. It might weird to say it but i love the stress that comes 
    with programming, its definitely adrenaline rush. I love seeing my end product even if its not that much. Anyways feel free to click on my other links at the top of this page :)</p>
